          <h3>Archetyped ECS</h3>
          <p>
            This is a personal project of mine that follow an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture that makes writing high performance code easy.
            Its 'one line' modular, so a new system or new component can be registered and start running with a single line of code.
            Many features get generated through reflection, such as UI and serialization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The video is showing 125k entities running at 60fps with a 0.1% ECS overhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Want to talk about:
            - Engine Highlevel Overview
              - The engine aims to be a sandbox where I can efficiently create and maintain features
              - Currently Implemented
                - Spatial Audio
                - Serialization
                - Models/Animations
                - Collision Detection
                - Cubic Spines
              - This engine api follows an 
                - ECS Archetypes, iteration interface
              - PBR algorithym,
              - Shadow algorithym
              - Keyed Vector (std::hive)
              - gpu_vector
              - Modular EngineManger
              - Reflection based component management.

          <h3>Physically Based Rendering</h3>
          <p>
            This a renderer that follows many efficient rendering techniques. It uses deffered rendering, batched rendering, and bindless rendering. 
            It supports shadow mapping following momentum shadow smoothing, Physically-Based-Rendering(PBR), and
            Image-Based-Lighting(IBL). The engine also has support for both point light and directional lights.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a C++ programmer focused on game engine and systems development. I enjoy working close to hardware on performance-critical systems such as ECS architectures, rendering pipelines, and tooling.</p>
      <p>I am currently studying Real-Time Interactive Simulation at DigiPen and building a custom engine and editor, with an emphasis on clean APIs, data-driven design, and debuggability. I am seeking software engineering or engine programming roles where I can contribute to complex systems and continue learning from experienced engineers.</p>
